    <h1 class="center">Lighthouse Melodies</h1>
    <p>In a quaint town nestled by the sea, a lighthouse stood sentinel, its beacon guiding sailors through stormy
        nights.

        Yet, its keeper, an old man named Elias, harbored a secret. Each evening, he'd climb the tower, not to light
        the
        lamp,

        but to play his violin, a melody that echoed across the waves, soothing troubled souls and bringing hope to
        weary hearts.
